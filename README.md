# Webscraping British Airways Reviews :airplane:

:red_circle: This project analyzes customer reviews of British Airlines using web scraping with Python. Key findings include the most common words used in positive and negative reviews, the percentage of verified and unverified reviews, and the countries providing the most positive and negative reviews. The project also includes heat maps to visualize the data. Overall, the insights gained from this analysis can help British Airlines improve customer satisfaction and loyalty.

My findings are also available in presentation form in this [PowerPoint Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1QLl8LwVGhzJZ2z16n4-nPCx_VZC5MjFx/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=100374431930809922639&rtpof=true&sd=true)
